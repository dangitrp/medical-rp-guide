# Codes and Alerts
Code Blue is the only recommended color code to be used with alerts. Plain Language Alerts have been recommended by multiple states to replace them.

## Code Blue
No Pulse and No Breathing

- Establish the criteria for a code blue
  - Airway is clear
  - Patient has no pulse
  - Patient is not breathing
  - No open chest wound
- Start CPR
- Remove clothing to allow access to chest
  - Ensure it is dry
- Turn on the AED and attach the pads
- Allow the machine to analyze the patient for a shockable rhythm
  - If no shockable rhythm, continue CPR
  - If shockable rhythm detected, start the AED
- The AED will automatically deliver the appropriate energy levels for each shock. 
- After three attempts to shock the patient, transport to the hospital while continuing to do CPR if able.
