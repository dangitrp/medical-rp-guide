# Mental Health

If you are wanting to engage in mental health therapy roleplay, it is encouraged to have an OOC discussion about where the other player wants their story to go. That way you can work with them in-character to get there. Remember this guide is only to assist in roleplay and is not a substitute for seeing a mental health professional.

## OOC Mental Health Resources

It is very possible OOC mental health issues of a player can cross the lines to an IC character. Do not attempt to treat an OOC issue. Trained professionals are available at the following resources to help with OOC issues:

- For emergency help 
  - Call 911.
- For suicidal thoughts and behavior 
  - Dial 988 for the [Suicide & Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/). 
  - You can also reach them at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).
- For mental health issues after a disaster 
  - Contact the [Disaster Distress Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline) at 1-800-985-5990.
- For veterans experiencing a crisis 
  - Contact the [Veterans Crisis Line](https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/) at 988 (then press 1).
- For people experiencing domestic violence 
  - Contact the [National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/) at 1-800-799-7233.

## Psychiatric Exams

Prior to diagnosis, reach out to the player OOC to determine how they would like their story to move forward. Remember to allow the player to have full-control over their story and not to power-game them with a diagnosis or treatment. This type of roleplay is to help support their story, not break it down. When having the OOC discussion, ask what they are hoping to gain from a session, such as:

- Ask which mental health issue they would like to address
- Documentation of a diagnosis
- Medication
- Continued sessions (potential character development)
- Work Clearance

## Therapy Techniques

###  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

#### Understanding Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors:

In CBT, patients learn to understand the intricate relationship between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The therapist helps them recognize that their thoughts (cognitions) have a powerful influence on their emotions and actions. By understanding this connection, patients gain insight into how changing their thoughts can lead to changes in their emotions and behaviors.

During therapy sessions, the therapist uses examples and illustrations to explain this relationship. They might ask the patient to recall a recent situation where they experienced strong emotions, such as anxiety or anger, and explore the thoughts that preceded those feelings. Through this process, patients begin to see how their interpretations of events shape their emotional responses.

#### Identifying Negative Thought Patterns:

One of the key tasks in CBT is identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, also known as cognitive distortions. These distortions are irrational or unhelpful ways of thinking that contribute to negative emotions and behaviors. Common cognitive distortions include:

- All-or-nothing thinking (seeing situations as either completely good or completely bad)
- Catastrophizing (imagining the worst-case scenario)
- Overgeneralization (drawing broad conclusions from limited evidence)
- Personalization (attributing external events to oneself)

The therapist helps the patient recognize these cognitive distortions by providing examples and encouraging self-reflection. They might use worksheets or thought records to facilitate this process, prompting the patient to identify and label their automatic thoughts.

#### Challenging and Restructuring Thoughts:

Once negative thought patterns are identified, the therapist guides the patient in challenging and restructuring these thoughts. This involves examining the evidence for and against the negative thoughts and developing more balanced and realistic perspectives.

The therapist acts as a collaborator, helping the patient question the accuracy and validity of their negative thoughts. They might ask probing questions such as:

- What evidence supports this thought?
- What evidence contradicts this thought?
- Are there alternative explanations or interpretations?
- What would a friend say about this situation?

Through this process, patients learn to replace irrational or unhelpful thoughts with more adaptive ones. They develop a toolkit of coping strategies and cognitive restructuring techniques that they can apply independently outside of therapy sessions.

#### Behavioral Activation:

In addition to addressing cognitive patterns, CBT often includes behavioral activation techniques. Behavioral activation aims to increase engagement in rewarding and meaningful activities, which can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.

The therapist collaborates with the patient to identify activities that they enjoy or find fulfilling. These activities can be simple pleasures such as hobbies, socializing with friends, or engaging in physical exercise. The therapist helps the patient set specific, achievable goals for incorporating these activities into their daily routine.

Behavioral activation involves breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps. The therapist may encourage the patient to schedule these activities on a daily or weekly basis, using a planner or calendar to track progress. By gradually increasing their participation in positive activities, patients experience a sense of accomplishment and pleasure, which can counteract feelings of hopelessness or lethargy.

Overall, CBT is a structured, goal-oriented approach to therapy that empowers patients to recognize and challenge negative thought patterns, develop effective coping strategies, and make positive changes in their behavior and emotions. Through collaboration with their therapist and consistent practice of CBT techniques, patients can gain greater self-awareness, resilience, and improved mental well-being.

### Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

#### Mindfulness Skills:

DBT emphasizes mindfulness as a foundational skill to help individuals develop awareness of their thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judgment. Mindfulness practices encourage patients to stay present in the moment, observe their experiences without trying to change them, and cultivate an attitude of acceptance.

**Mindfulness Exercises:**
Therapists teach patients various mindfulness exercises, such as mindful breathing, body scan, and mindfulness of emotions. These exercises can be practiced both formally (during dedicated mindfulness sessions) and informally (during daily activities).

**Observing and Describing:**
Patients learn to observe their experiences without reacting impulsively and to describe them using nonjudgmental language. For example, they might practice observing their thoughts as passing clouds or describing physical sensations without attaching labels or interpretations to them.

#### Distress Tolerance:

Distress tolerance skills help individuals cope with intense emotions and distressing situations without resorting to harmful or impulsive behaviors. These skills are particularly useful during crises or times of heightened emotional arousal.

**Self-Soothing Techniques:**
Patients learn self-soothing strategies to comfort themselves during times of distress. This may involve engaging in activities that evoke a sense of safety and comfort, such as taking a warm bath, listening to calming music, or wrapping oneself in a cozy blanket.

**Distraction:**
Distraction techniques help shift attention away from distressing thoughts or emotions. Patients are encouraged to engage in activities that occupy their mind and provide temporary relief from emotional pain, such as watching a funny movie, going for a walk, or practicing a hobby.

**Radical Acceptance:**
Radical acceptance involves acknowledging and accepting reality as it is, without judgment or resistance. Patients learn to let go of futile efforts to change or control circumstances beyond their control and to embrace acceptance as a path to inner peace.

#### Emotion Regulation:

Emotion regulation skills help individuals identify, understand, and manage their emotions more effectively. By developing greater emotional awareness and coping strategies, patients can reduce emotional vulnerability and improve overall well-being.

**Identifying Emotions:**
Patients learn to identify and label their emotions accurately. This may involve expanding their emotional vocabulary and recognizing subtle variations in emotional experiences.

**Opposite Action:**
Opposite action involves acting opposite to the urge of an emotion. For example, if someone feels like withdrawing or isolating when they're sad, they might practice reaching out to a friend or engaging in social activities instead.

**Checking the Facts:**
Patients are taught to challenge emotional interpretations by examining the evidence for and against their emotions. This helps them develop a more balanced and objective perspective on their experiences.

#### Interpersonal Effectiveness:

Interpersonal effectiveness skills focus on improving communication and relationships with others. By learning effective communication strategies and boundary-setting techniques, patients can navigate interpersonal interactions more skillfully and build healthier relationships.

**DEAR MAN:**
DEAR MAN is an acronym that stands for Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce, Stay Mindful, Appear Confident, and Negotiate. It provides a structured approach to assertive communication and problem-solving in interpersonal interactions.

**GIVE:**
GIVE is another acronym that stands for Gentle, Interested, Validate, and Easy Manner. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a respectful and compassionate demeanor in relationships.

**Role-Playing:**
Role-playing exercises allow patients to practice interpersonal skills in a safe and supportive environment. Therapists may role-play various scenarios with patients or encourage them to role-play interactions with friends or family members outside of therapy sessions.

Overall, DBT is a comprehensive and integrative approach to therapy that combines elements of mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. By mastering these skills, patients can develop greater self-awareness, emotional resilience, and interpersonal effectiveness, leading to improved overall functioning and well-being.
