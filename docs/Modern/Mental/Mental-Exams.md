## OOC Sync-Up

Prior to diagnosis, reach out to the player OOC to determine how they would like their story to move forward. Remember to allow the player to have full-control over their story and not to power-game them with a diagnosis or treatment. This type of roleplay is to help support their story, not break it down. When having the OOC discussion, ask what they are hoping to gain from a session, such as:

- Ask which mental health issue they would like to address
- Documentation of a diagnosis
- Medication
- Continued sessions (potential character development)
- Work Clearance
