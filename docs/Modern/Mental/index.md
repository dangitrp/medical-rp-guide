# Mental Health

If you are wanting to engage in mental health therapy roleplay, it is encouraged to have an OOC discussion about where the other player wants their story to go. That way you can work with them in-character to get there. 

**Remember this guide is only to assist in roleplay and is not a substitute for seeing a mental health professional for OOC issues.**

## OOC Mental Health Resources

It is very possible OOC mental health issues of a player can cross the lines to an IC character. Do not attempt to treat an OOC issue. Trained professionals are available at the following resources to help with OOC issues:

  - Call 911.
