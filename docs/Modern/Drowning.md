# Drowning

## On Scene

- Ensure safety of the scene
- If the victim is still in the water, initiate a water rescue
- Remove the patient from the water
- Check Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC)
- If victim is not breathing, start CPR
- Provide rescue breaths if needed
- Continue CPR until victim starts breathing
- If patient was in salt water, administer the diuretic Lasix to prevent the body from absorbing salt
- Stabilize the patient and prepare for transport if needed
- Monitor the patient's vitals
- Hand off the patient to hospital staff, detailing the situation and what you did

## In the Hospital

- Assess the patient's ABC's (Airway, breathing, circulation)
- Stabilize the patient if needed
- If patient loses breathing, intubate and ventilate
- Administer high-flow oxygen to improve saturation
- Perform a chest X-ray to see if there is any aspiration (fluid) or lung injury
  - If there is fluid in the windpipe, take a hollow needle to drain the fluid
  - If fluid is in the lungs, push a diuretic and antibiotic to reduce fluid and prevent infection
- Once treated, move the patient to a recovery space
