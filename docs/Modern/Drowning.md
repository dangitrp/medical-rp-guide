# Drowning

## On Scene
- Put PT onto side
- Pat their back to help them cough up water
- Once PT coughs up water, place them back onto their back
- Check Vitals
- If no pulse, perform CPR
  - CPR (2 rounds of 30 compressions & 2 breaths)
  - Check for success
- If still no pulse, perform AED
  - Cut PT shirt open (if they have one on)
  - Dry PT off with dry towel
  - Apply AED pads to PT in the dry area
  - Push the button on AED to find a shockable rhythm
  - Once a shockable rhythm is found, shock the PT.
  - If not revived after first shock, administer Epi
  - Can shock PT up to 3 times
  - Confirm stable pulse
- Place O2 Mask
- Start IV w/ Lasix (if salt water)
- Transport PT to hospital


## In the Hospital

- Assess the patient's ABC's (Airway, breathing, circulation)
- Stabilize the patient if needed
- If patient loses breathing, intubate and ventilate
- Administer high-flow oxygen to improve saturation
- Perform a chest X-ray to see if there is any aspiration (fluid) or lung injury
  - If there is fluid in the windpipe, take a hollow needle to drain the fluid
  - If fluid is in the lungs, push a diuretic and antibiotic to reduce fluid and prevent infection
- Once treated, move the patient to a recovery space
