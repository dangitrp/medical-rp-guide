## Non-Displaced Fracture
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangitrp/medical-rp-guide/main/assets/images/fracture-nondisplaced.jpg)

The bone is boken, however both sections of the bone are still aligned and once healed does not inhibity the function of the limb or area of the body.

- Provide pain medication as needed
- Ice for swelling and pain management
- then (if possible) cast the limb
  - Spine, Skull, Ribs are non castable.
  - Ribs will heal over time on their own,
  - Spine and Skull will require fixation.
