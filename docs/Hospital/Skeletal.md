![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangitrp/medical-rp-guide/main/assets/images/fracture-nondisplaced.jpg)

The bone is boken, however both sections of the bone are still aligned and once healed does not inhibity the function of the limb or area of the body.

- Provide pain medication as needed
- Ice for swelling and pain management
- then (if possible) cast the limb
  - Spine, Skull, Ribs are non castable.
  - Ribs will heal over time on their own,
  - Spine and Skull will require fixation.

The bone is boken, sections of the bone are no longer aligned and before proper healing can occur the bones must be aligned

- Provide pain medication as needed
- Ice for swelling and pain management
- Evaluate if you can set the bone without surgery
  - Non-Surgical
     - This will require physical manipulation. Pulling and or turning limbs to re-align bone fragments
     - New Imaging to insure bone alignment
     - Once confirmed proceed to casting
  - Surgical
     - Anesthetize the Patient and Intubate or do a Local Nerve block to limb if possible with o2 mask
     - Large enough incision to gain access to affected area
     - Saline and Bacitrcin to flush loose debri
     - Suction to clear surgical area
     - Align Fragments and fixate - This may include plates, screws, pins, rods to imobilize fragments
     - Saline and Bacitrcin to flush loose debri
     - Suctionn to clear surgical area
     - Close surgical site, apply ointment, cover with clean/sterile guaze
- then (if possible) cast the limb - For Surgical procedures make the cast removable for wound care
  - Spine, Skull, Ribs are non castable. 
  - Ribs will heal over time on their own, 
  - Spine and Skull will require fixation.
