# Drowning

- Assess the patient's ABC's (Airway, breathing, circulation)
- Stabilize the patient if needed
- If patient loses breathing, intubate and ventilate
- Administer high-flow oxygen to improve saturation
- Perform a chest X-ray to see if there is any aspiration (fluid) or lung injury
  - If there is fluid in the windpipe, take a hollow needle to drain the fluid
  - If fluid is in the lungs, push a diuretic and antibiotic to reduce fluid and prevent infection
- Once treated, move the patient to a recovery space
