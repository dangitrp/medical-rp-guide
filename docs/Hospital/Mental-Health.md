# Mental Health

If you are wanting to engage in mental health therapy roleplay, it is encouraged to have an OOC discussion about where the other player wants their story to go. That way you can work with them in-character to get there. Remember this guide is only to assist in roleplay and is not a substitute for seeing a mental health professional.

## OOC Mental Health Resources

It is very possible OOC mental health issues of a player can cross the lines to an IC character. Trained professionals are available at the following resources to help with OOC issues:

- For emergency help - call 911.
- For suicidal thoughts and behavior - dial 988 for the [Suicide & Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/). You can also reach them at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).
- For mental health issues after a disaster - contact the [Disaster Distress Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline) at 1-800-985-5990.
- For veterans experiencing a crisis - contact the [Veterans Crisis Line](https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/) at 988 (then press 1).
- For people experiencing domestic violence - contact the [National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/) at 1-800-799-7233.

## Roleplay Mental Health Issues

Prior to diagnosis, reach out to the player OOC to determine how they would like their story to move forward. Remember to allow the player to have full-control over their story and not to power-game them with a diagnosis or treatment. This type of roleplay is to help support their story, not break it down. When having the OOC discussion, ask what they are hoping to gain from a session, such as:

- Ask which mental health issue they would like to address
- Documentation of a diagnosis
- Medication
- Continued sessions (potential character development)
