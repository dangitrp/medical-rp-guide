# Imaging

## Xray
An X-ray machine is like a powerful camera that takes pictures of the inside of your body using invisible rays called X-rays. It helps doctors see through your skin and muscles to capture images of your bones and organs, making it useful for checking broken bones, lung or stomach issues, and heart health. When you get an X-ray, you might wear a lead apron to protect some parts of your body, and the machine looks like a big box with a movable camera for the best pictures.

## CT Scan (Computed Tomography)
A CT scan is like an advanced X-ray that makes a 3D picture of the inside of your body, showing detailed slices like a loaf of bread. The machine, shaped like a donut, takes pictures from different angles using X-rays and computer technology. This helps doctors see your bones, organs, and tissues more clearly to identify any problems. It's quick and may involve some buzzing sounds while the machine creates the detailed images.

## Sonogram / Ultra-Sound
A sonogram, or ultrasound, is a medical imaging technique that uses sound waves to create real-time images of the inside of the body. Unlike pregnancy-related sonograms, which monitor the development of a baby, non-pregnancy sonograms are used to visualize and assess various organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and other soft tissues. The procedure involves a transducer emitting sound waves that bounce back, creating detailed images that help doctors diagnose and monitor conditions without exposing the patient to radiation. It's a valuable tool for examining different parts of the body and understanding their health.

## MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a medical test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It's like taking a high-resolution picture that helps doctors see organs, tissues, and bones in great detail. During the MRI, the patient lies inside a large tube, and the machine captures signals emitted by the body to construct cross-sectional images. This non-invasive procedure is valuable for diagnosing a wide range of medical conditions and provides a comprehensive view without using X-rays.
