# Imaging

## Xray
An X-ray machine is like a powerful camera that takes pictures of the inside of your body using invisible rays called X-rays. It helps doctors see through your skin and muscles to capture images of your bones and organs, making it useful for checking broken bones, lung or stomach issues, and heart health. When you get an X-ray, you might wear a lead apron to protect some parts of your body, and the machine looks like a big box with a movable camera for the best pictures.

- Move the patient to the Xray Room
- Place them on the bed
- Put on a lead apron yourself
- Start the imaging
- Pull the image out of the machine
- Place it on the projector
- Use /OOC or /ME to let the patient describe what you see

## CT Scan (Computed Tomography)
A CT scan is like an advanced X-ray that makes a 3D picture of the inside of your body, showing detailed slices like a loaf of bread. The machine, shaped like a donut, takes pictures from different angles using X-rays and computer technology. This helps doctors see your bones, organs, and tissues more clearly to identify any problems. It's quick and may involve some buzzing sounds while the machine creates the detailed images.

The machine looks similar to an MRI and can be used in RP as either machine

- Move the patient to the MRI/CT Room
- Place them on the bed
- Explain you are about to start the machine and will be in the next room
- Move to the next room
- State you are starting the machine
- Use /OOC or /ME to see what the injuries are from the patient
- Move the patient to an exam room and describe the findings

## MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a medical test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It's like taking a high-resolution picture that helps doctors see organs, tissues, and bones in great detail. During the MRI, the patient lies inside a large tube, and the machine captures signals emitted by the body to construct cross-sectional images. This non-invasive procedure is valuable for diagnosing a wide range of medical conditions and provides a comprehensive view without using X-rays.

The machine looks similar to a CT and can be used in RP as either machine

- Have the patient remove anything metal
- Move the patient to the MRI/CT Room
- Place them on the bed
- Explain you are about to start the machine and will be in the next room
- Move to the next room
- State you are starting the machine
- Use /OOC or /ME to see what the injuries are from the patient
- Move the patient to an exam room and describe the findings

**REMOVE ALL METAL ITEMS BEFORE USING THE MRI**

## Sonogram / Ultra-Sound
A sonogram, or ultrasound, is a medical imaging technique that uses sound waves to create real-time images of the inside of the body. Unlike pregnancy-related sonograms, which monitor the development of a baby, non-pregnancy sonograms are used to visualize and assess various organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and other soft tissues. The procedure involves a transducer emitting sound waves that bounce back, creating detailed images that help doctors diagnose and monitor conditions without exposing the patient to radiation. It's a valuable tool for examining different parts of the body and understanding their health.

This can be done in an exam room or in surgery

- Apply some sonography gel to the transducer
- Rub the transducer on the patient going over the areas of concern
- Check for organ damage, blood flow, etc
- Use /OOC or /ME to let the patient describe the injuries
- Remove the probe
- Describe your findings
