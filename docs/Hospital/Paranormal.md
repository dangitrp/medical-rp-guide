# Paranormal Medicine

First and Foremost, remember that you do not have to believe a character is a paranormal patient. Just be mindful to not powergame the other player. You are always welcome to call in another doctor, or send the patient to "Nancy" if you do not feel comfortable treating them. Paranormal patients also bring in the ability to call non-medical staff to your assistance (such as a mechanic for a robot or animal control for a loose cow or horse).
