## Permitted Uses and Disclosure

**When in doubt, defer the request to a higher ranking member of your team.**

The law permits, but does not require, a covered entity to use and disclose PHI, without an individual’s authorization, for the following purposes or situations:

- Disclosure to the individual (if the information is required for access or accounting of disclosures, the entity MUST disclose to the individual)
- Treatment, payment, and healthcare operations
- Opportunity to agree or object to the disclosure of PHI
  - An entity can obtain informal permission by asking the individual outright, or by circumstances that clearly give the individual the opportunity to agree, acquiesce, or object
- Incident to an otherwise permitted use and disclosure
- Limited dataset for research, public health, or healthcare operations
- Public interest and benefit activities—The Privacy Rule permits use and disclosure of PHI, without an individual’s authorization or permission, for 12 national priority purposes:
  - When required by law
  - Public health activities
  - Victims of abuse or neglect or domestic violence
  - Health oversight activities
  - Judicial and administrative proceedings
  - Law enforcement
    - as required by law (including court orders, court-ordered warrants, subpoenas) and administrative requests; 
    - to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person; 
    - in response to a law enforcement official's request for information about a victim or suspected victim of a crime; 
    - to alert law enforcement of a person's death, if the covered entity suspects that criminal activity caused the death; 
    - when a covered entity believes that protected health information is evidence of a crime that occurred on its premises; and 
    - by a covered health care provider in a medical emergency not occurring on its premises, when necessary to inform law enforcement about the commission and nature of a crime, the location of the crime or crime victims, and the perpetrator of the crime.
  - Functions (such as identification) concerning deceased persons
  - Cadaveric organ, eye, or tissue donation
