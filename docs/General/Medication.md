# Medication Classes and Examples
## Analgesics (Pain Killers)

These are pain relievers and fever reducers. For our use they will be broken down into two sub-categories: Non-narcotic analgesics for minor to moderate pain, and narcotic analgesic for severe pain.

Some non-narcotic analgesics include:
* Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
* Ibuprofen (Motrin)
* Naproxen (Aleve)

Some narcotic analgesics include:
* Tramadol (Ultram)
* Oxycodone-Acetaminophen (Percocet)
* Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen (Vicodin)

Use your judgment when determining the pain level of the patient, and always err on the side of caution when a patient comes in and immediately asks for narcotics. It will happen more than you might be prepared for.

## Anticonvulsants (Seizures)

These help to normalize the way nerve impulses travel along the nerve cells which helps prevent or treat seizures. When the brain is working normally the nerve cells talk to each other using controlled electrical signals from one nerve cell to another. This tells the body to do everything it needs or wants to do. During a seizure there is a change in the level of nerve cell electrical signals from a normal level to an excessive or abnormal amount of nerve signals. This increased nerve activity is responsible for the signs and symptoms of a seizure. There are many conditions that can trigger a seizure, and the situation you may be faced with most would be due to a traumatic brain injury. However, some anticonvulsants can also be used to treat neurological pain as well as bipolar disorder

Some anticonvulsants include:
* Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
* Phenytoin (Dilantin)
* Gabapentin (Neurontin)
* Primidone (Mysoline)

## Antiarrhythmic Agents (Heart)

These are a group of medicines that are used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rates or rhythms). Cardiac arrhythmias occur when there is a disturbance in the electrical conductivity of the heart. Causes are quite numerous and may include heart attacks, electrolyte disturbances, or infection.

Some antiarrhythmic agents include:
* Digoxin (Lanoxin)
* Adenosine (Adenocard)
* Propranolol (Inderal)
* Amiodarone (Cordarone)
* Diltiazem (Cardizem)

## Diuretics

Also called “water pills”, these are a class of drugs that help to rid your body of sodium, and water.They do so by helping your kidneys release more sodium into the urine, which in turn removes excess water from your bloodstream. This decreases the amount of fluid flowing through your veins and arteries, lowering your blood pressure.

Some diuretics include:
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Metolazone (Zaroxolyn)
* Spironolactone (Aldactone)
* Acetazolamide (Diamox)
* Hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide)

## Anti-infectives

These are a rather broad class of drugs that either kill an infectious agent within the body or prevent it from spreading. The type of drug called for in treatment depends on what type of infection is present in the host. These include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiprotozoals. For our usage, antiprotozoals won't be necessary unless Los Santos is faced with a Malaria outbreak or African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) so this was just added here for your own knowledge.I will break down each into groups of two as each drug you choose for treatment should have at least one alternative, especially regarding antibiotics with the prevalence of penicillin allergy in the population.

### Antibiotics
Used for bacterial infection, such as meningitis, appendicitis, or common UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)

* Amoxicillin (Amoxil) - Penicillin-based antibiotic
* Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim (Bactrim) - for use in patients with Penicillin allergy

### Antivirals
Used for treating viral infection, such as influenza, bronchitis, or streptococcal pharyngitis

* Amantadine (Symmetrel)
* Ritonavir (Norvir)

### Antifungals
Used to treat fungal infections, such as Athlete’s Foot, or Ringworm

* Clotrimazole (Lotrimin)
* Terbinafine (Lamisil)
