# Medication Classes and Examples
## Analgesics (Pain Killers)

These are pain relievers and fever reducers. For our use they will be broken down into two sub-categories: Non-narcotic analgesics for minor to moderate pain, and narcotic analgesic for severe pain.

### Mild Pain (Non-Narcotic, Pain 1-3)
* Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
* Ibuprofen (Motrin)
* Naproxen (Aleve)

### Moderate Pain (Pain 4-6)
* Tramadol (Ultram)
* Acetaminophen-Codeine (Tylenol-3/Vopac)
* Oxycodone-Acetaminophen (Percocet)
* Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen (Vicodin)

### Severe Pain (7-10)
* Morphine
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)

Use your judgment when determining the pain level of the patient, and always err on the side of caution when a patient comes in and immediately asks for narcotics. It will happen more than you might be prepared for.

## Anti-infectives

These are a rather broad class of drugs that either kill an infectious agent within the body or prevent it from spreading. The type of drug called for in treatment depends on what type of infection is present in the host. These include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiprotozoals. For our usage, antiprotozoals won't be necessary unless Los Santos is faced with a Malaria outbreak or African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) so this was just added here for your own knowledge.I will break down each into groups of two as each drug you choose for treatment should have at least one alternative, especially regarding antibiotics with the prevalence of penicillin allergy in the population.

### Antibiotics
Used for bacterial infection, such as meningitis, appendicitis, or common UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)

* Amoxicillin (Amoxil) - Penicillin-based antibiotic
* Vancomycin (Vancocin)  - Non-Penicillin
* Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim (Bactrim) - for use in patients with Penicillin allergy

### Antivirals
Used for treating viral infection, such as influenza, bronchitis, or streptococcal pharyngitis

* Acyclovir (Zovirax)
* Amantadine (Symmetrel)
* Ritonavir (Norvir)

### Antifungals
Used to treat fungal infections, such as Athlete’s Foot, or Ringworm

* Voriconazole (Vfend)
* Clotrimazole (Lotrimin)
* Terbinafine (Lamisil)

## Cardiovascular

### Hypertension
High blood pressure
* Nitroglycerin

### Hypotension
Low blood pressure
* Fludrocortisone (Florinef)

### Cardiac Arrest
* Epinephrine (Adrenaline)

### Tachycardia
High heart rate, tachycardia occurs when the heart rate is above 100 bpm.
* Diltiazem (Cardizem)

### Bradycardia
Low heart rate, bradycardia occurs when the heart rate is below 60 bpm.
* Epinephrine (Adrenaline)

### Coagulant
Controls or prevents excessive bleeding during surgery or after trauma by clotting the blood. Can create blood clots in the body if misused. Potentially deadly.
* Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

### Anticoagulant (Blood Thinner)
A patient on blood thinners will likely have more severe injuries in subsequent injuries after being on blood thinners as bleeding will be hard to stop.

* Warfarin
  * Requires follow-ups for dosage changes
* Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)
  * Does not require follow-ups
* Heparin
  * Used in the hospital only to reduce any further formation of blood clots or reduce risk of forming blood clots anywhere in the body

## Diuretics
Also called “water pills”, these are a class of drugs that help to rid your body of sodium, and water.They do so by helping your kidneys release more sodium into the urine, which in turn removes excess water from your bloodstream. This decreases the amount of fluid flowing through your veins and arteries, lowering your blood pressure.

Some diuretics include:
* Furosemide (Lasix)0
* Mannitol (Resectisol)
  * Used specifically for brain pressure/swelling
* Metolazone (Zaroxolyn)
* Spironolactone (Aldactone)
* Acetazolamide (Diamox)
* Hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide)

---

## Gastro-Intestinal

### Antiemetics (Anti-Nausea)
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
  * Used in this case as a 3rd line option in the hospital to treat nausea and vomiting, but also is a benzodiazepine with numerous other effects and is addictive.

## Neurological

### Anticonvulsants (Seizures)
These help to normalize the way nerve impulses travel along the nerve cells which helps prevent or treat seizures. When the brain is working normally the nerve cells talk to each other using controlled electrical signals from one nerve cell to another. This tells the body to do everything it needs or wants to do. During a seizure there is a change in the level of nerve cell electrical signals from a normal level to an excessive or abnormal amount of nerve signals. This increased nerve activity is responsible for the signs and symptoms of a seizure. There are many conditions that can trigger a seizure, and the situation you may be faced with most would be due to a traumatic brain injury. However, some anticonvulsants can also be used to treat neurological pain as well as bipolar disorder

Some anticonvulsants include:
* Gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise)
* Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
* Phenytoin (Dilantin)
* Primidone (Mysoline)

### Anxiolytics
Drugs that lower anxiety by calming the electrical activity in the brain.
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Diazepam

### Migraine and Cluster Headache Medications
Treats intense migraines or cluster headaches. Work particularly well if caught early.
* Sumatriptan (Imitrex)

---

## Poison Control

### Opiod Overdose
Treats overdose caused by opioids / narcotics.
* Naloxone (Narcan)

### Poisoning
Used for suspected poisonings; encourages emesis (vomiting) as well preventing the stomach from absorbing the poison into the body.
* Activated Charcoal

---

## Respiratory

### Antihistamines
* Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)

### Bronchodilators
Medications that relax and open the airway
* Albuterol (Salbutamol) (Ventolin HFA)

### Inhaled Corticosteroids
Medications that treat the inflammation in the lungs that cause breathing problems
* Fluticasone (Flovent HFA)
