# The Medical Roleplayer's Guidebook

This guide is designed to help beginner medical roleplayers with zero knowledge learn about medical roleplay and hone in their skill to create an amazing experience for both the patient and themselves in games such as Grand Theft Auto 5 (FiveM) and others. 

The goal of this guide is to provide a simple framework of how to treat different kinds of injuries and to help build confidence for those who may have never played as a medical staffer. This guide is server agnostic and designed to help medical roleplayers in general, not just on a specific server. Many of the contributors operate on the Prodigy RP server.

As this is roleplay, always remember to **suspend your disbelief (become more gullible)** and **have fun** with the situations before you. You might go from treating a patient with a simple scratch, to trying to fix a robot with a disassembled toaster and stool leg, to becoming a world-class veternarian treating a dinosaur that has been previously extinct all in the same day. Injuries, Diseases, and situations that happen in roleplay are sometimes impossible, impractical, or just don't make sense. Roll with it and enjoy the story.

## Contributions

For those who would like to make contribuitons to this guide, the plan with this is to keep the documents under Hospital and Ambulatory Services at an extremely basic level. Don't stress too much about a specific name of a medication. Simply stating "Push an antibiotic through an IV" or "Administer a local anasthetic" or "Apply antibiotic ointment" is perfectly acceptable.

For more advanced topics, feel free to include information under General Medical that you think may be beneficial for a medical roleplayer to know.
