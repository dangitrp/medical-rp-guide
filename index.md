# The Medical Roleplayer's Guidebook

This guide is designed to help beginner medical roleplayers with zero knowledge learn about medical roleplay and hone in their skill to create an amazing experience for both the patient and themselves in games such as Grand Theft Auto 5 (FiveM) and others. 

The goal of this guide is to provide a simple framework of how to treat different kinds of injuries and to help build confidence for those who may have never played as a medical staffer. This guide is server agnostic and designed to help medical roleplayers in general, not just on a specific server. Many of the contributors operate on the Prodigy RP server.

As this is roleplay, always remember to **suspend your disbelief (become more gullible)** and **have fun** with the situations before you. You might go from treating a patient with a simple scratch, to trying to fix a robot with a disassembled toaster and stool leg, to becoming a world-class veternarian treating a dinosaur that has been previously extinct all in the same day. Injuries, Diseases, and situations that happen in roleplay are sometimes impossible, impractical, or just don't make sense. Roll with it and enjoy the story.

## Contributions

For those who would like to make contribuitons to this guide, the plan with this is to keep the documents under Hospital and Ambulatory Services at an extremely basic level. Don't stress too much about a specific name of a medication. Simply stating "Push an antibiotic through an IV" or "Administer a local anasthetic" or "Apply antibiotic ointment" is perfectly acceptable.

### Expectations for Documentation
- Follow the KISS Method when writing documentation (Keep it simple, stupid!)
  - Remember our primary audience is people who are new to medical roleplay and may have zero knowledge of things
  - Keep procedures basic and words simple
  - Make sure you introduce the full description when using an acronym
- Try to limit the amount of clicks/scrolling needed to get to the important information
  - Staffers may be using this guide while they are trying to roleplay
- Write the basic steps of the procedure
- If you give a medication, describe drug class rather than a specific name (unless the injury calls for a very specific medication)
  - "Push an antibiotic" instead of "Push Amoxicillin"

For more advanced topics, feel free to include information under General Medical that you think may be beneficial for a medical roleplayer to know.
