# The Medical Roleplayer's Guidebook

This guide is designed to help beginner medical roleplayers in games such as Grand Theft Auto 5 (FiveM) and others learn about medical roleplay and hone in their skill to create an amazing experience for both the patient and themselves. 

The goal of this guide is to provide a simple framework of how to treat different kinds of injuries and to help build confidence for those who may have never played as a medical staffer.

As this is roleplay, always remember to **suspend your disbelief (become more gullible)** and **have fun** with the situations before you. You might go from treating a patient with a simple scratch, to trying to fix a robot with a disassembled toaster and stool leg, to becoming a world-class veternarian treating a dinosaur that has been previously extinct all in the same day. Injuries, Diseases, and situations that happen in roleplay are sometimes impossible, impractical, or just don't make sense. Roll with it and enjoy the story.
